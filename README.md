# Smart Recycling using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to reduce recycling contamination by using deep learning to classify waste as recyclable or non-recyclable. Users can upload images, and the model will provide classification labels, helping to improve recycling practices.

## Features

- Image classification for waste management
- Binary classification: Recyclable vs. Non-Recyclable
- Utilizes datasets from multiple sources to enhance accuracy
- Custom dataset with over 25,000 images

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

- **Training Set**: 23,261 images (10,000 recyclable, 13,261 non-recyclable)
- **Test Set**: 2,721 images (1,113 recyclable, 1,608 non-recyclable)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Recycling.git
```
